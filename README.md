# A Start Algorithm in Artificial Intelligence

## Instructions

- Copy all the files and run the "MainAppGrid.py" file
- If they want any library to install then install it like "tkinter"
- The grid will show up. Now Select the "green" color from top which represents "source" and "yellow" color represents
    "destination" place it on the grid.
- Now select red color which are hurdles and place it on the screen
- After that press the start/play button
- Now wait for the result
- Wait wait wait (Movement is not visible on the grid)
- After completion, shortest path will shown up.

- To change the grid size. There is a global variable in "MainAppGrid.py" file with name "DEFAULT_N" whose value is 40. Change that value only



***NOTE: Algorithm is in A_Star_Search.py file. There is class in state.py whose objects are used and stored in list of algorithm. And required
	methods are present in A_Star_methods.py file***



## Grid identifiers
```
 initialize whole grid
> Goal State             (yellow color)
> backtrack of path      (cyan)
> start state            (green)
> hurdle                 (red)
> already explored       (black)
> current state          (magenta)
```
